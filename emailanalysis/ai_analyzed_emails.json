With the Find Hub network, you'll be able to locate your devices  \r\neven if they're offline. You can also find any compatible Fast Pair  \r\naccessories when they're disconnected from your device. This includes  \r\ncompatible earbuds and headphones, and trackers that you can attach to your  \r\nwallet, keys, or bike.\r\n\r\nTo help you find your items when they're offline, Find Hub will use the  \r\nnetwork of over a billion devices in the Android community and store your  \r\ndevices' recent locations.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nDevices in the network use Bluetooth to scan for nearby items. If other  \r\ndevices detect your items, they'll securely send the locations where the  \r\nitems were detected to Find Hub. Your Android devices will do the same to  \r\nhelp others find their offline items when detected nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour devices' locations will be encrypted using the PIN, pattern, or  \r\npassword for your Android devices. They can only be seen by you and those  \r\nyou share your devices with in Find Hub. They will not be visible to Google  \r\nor used for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll get a notification on your Android devices when this feature is  \r\nturned on in 3 days. Until then, you can opt out of the network through  \r\nFind Hub on the web. Your choice will apply to all Android devices linked  \r\nto abirehsanevan@gmail.com. After the feature is on, you can manage device  \r\nparticipation anytime through Find Hub settings on the device.\r\n\r\nLearn more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou received this email to update you about important changes to your  \r\nAndroid device.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 2026 Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
